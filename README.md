***Extract***
Extract gives you a UI panel to quickly add EXtractoR and Exposure effects to any selected layers with the click of a single button! You can also optionally check and uncheck which of the effects you want to add, while also customizing the Gamma Correction (default 2.2) of the Exposure effect by typing in the provided text field.

Install *Extract* by placing the .jsx file into your After Effects installation directory
For example: "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2019\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels".

Load up AE, and go to Window. Select the UI Script from the bottom of the list.
