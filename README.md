# AETools

***EXR Workflow***
EXR Workflow gives you a UI panel to quickly add EXtractoR and Exposure effects to any selected layers with the click of a single button! You can also optionally check and uncheck which of the effects you want to add, while also customizing the Gamma Correction (default 2.2) of the Exposure effect by typing in the provided text field.

***Quick FX***
QuickFX adds an additional section to the panel using commonly-used effects. These are hardcoded for the timing-being, but will hopefully become dynamically added in the future by the user.

***Chroma FX***
ChromaFX adds an additional section to the panel that contains effects used commonly in a green-screen or matting workflow.


Install AETools by downloading the .jsx from the 'QuickFX' folder. Place the .jsx file into your After Effects installation directory.
For example: "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2019\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels".

Load up AE, and go to Window. Select the UI Script from the bottom of the list.
